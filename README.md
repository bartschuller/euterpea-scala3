# Euterpea and Jazzkell in Scala 3

These are ports by me (Bart Schuller) to Scala 3/Dotty 0.26 of [Euterpea](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2) and [Jazzkell](https://github.com/donya/Jazzkell) by Donya Quick.

## Status

This currently depends on a piece of unreleased software, but only lightly:
- My own (rather pointless) Scala wrappers around `javax.sound.midi.*`

On the one hand, this is my playground for getting to know Scala 3. On the other hand, the examples all work and produce sound. I can't do a direct comparison with the Haskell originals because it's become too hard to install them if you're a Haskell newbie like me.
