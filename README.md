# Euterpea and Jazzkell in Scala 3

These are ports by me (Bart Schuller) to Scala 3/Dotty 0.19 of [Euterpea](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2) and [Jazzkell](https://github.com/donya/Jazzkell) by Donya Quick.

See the [license file](LICENSE.md) for copyright and licensing information (not everything is Open Source).

## Status

This currently depends on 2 pieces of unreleased software, but only lightly:
- Infix `max` and `min` for [spire-scala3](https://github.com/bishabosha/spire-scala3)
- My own (rather pointless) Scala wrappers around `javax.sound.midi.*`

On the one hand, this is my playground for getting to know Scala 3. On the other hand, the Jazzkell examples all work and produce sound. I can't do a direct comparison with the Haskell originals because it's become too hard to install them if you're a Haskell newbie like me.
